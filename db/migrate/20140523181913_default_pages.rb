<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<hr>
<h3>What is Ruck.us?</h3>
<p>Ruck.us is an uber-simple political website builder designed specifically for state and local candidates.  We know how challenging - and expensive - a high quality website can be.  So we have taken the best of political websites and built a template that you can use to build your own a powerful, professional, and attractive political website in minutes!</p>
<p>Features include personalized url, donation processing, email acquisition, social media integration, and a unique “ask me a question” feature.</p>
<p>If you are a candidate without a website or if you are unhappy with your current website, Ruck.us is for you!</p>
<h3>How much does Ruck.us cost?</h3>
<p>Ruck.us is absolutely free to set up. We take a 2% fee on all donations processed. You only pay, therefore, when you raise money.  (This is on top of card processing fees, for which we have negotiated a low 3.75% + $0.20 flat fee without any hidden charges.)</p>
<h3>Who can get a Ruck.us website?</h3>
<p>Anyone and everyone. You do not have to be an announced candidate to get a Ruck.us website.  You can also use Ruck.us for issue organizing, coalition work, etc.</p>
<h3>Is Ruck.us Democratic or Republican?</h3>
<p>Neither. We are a nonpartisan digital toolkit for state and local political candidates.</p>
<h3>How do I set up my Ruck.us account?</h3>
<p>Its simple.  Just go to <a href="http://www.ruck.us" target="_blank">www.ruck.us</a> and click “Start Building Now.” We will guide you through an easy setup process.  You will be up and running with your own personal website in minutes!</p>
<h3>Can I direct my existing campaign URL to Ruck.us?</h3>
<p>Yes. Most web registrars have a feature in their account settings panel where you can select 'URL Redirects.'  Enter your Ruck.us website address (<a href="http://www.ruck.us">http://www.youraccountname.ruck.us</a>) and the domain should properly redirect within 24 hours.</p>
<h3>How do I hide my page from others?</h3>
<p>Ruck.us pages are live from the moment you create them.  However, there are three easy ways for you to hide your page from prying eyes until you are ready to reveal it. First, if you do not share your page’s URL (<a href="http://www.ruck.us">http://YOURPAGE.ruck.us</a>) with others, they can’t find it, and if you do not link to it from elsewhere on the web, search engines can’t find it either. Second, if you have shared the URL in the past, you can temporarily change it to something new (which will now be unknown to people and search engines), and then change it back when you are ok with folks finding it again. And, finally, you can always deactivate your account entirely (under Settings/My Account).</p>
<h3>What if I forgot my password?</h3>
<p>No problem.  When you go to our home page (<a href="http://www.ruck.us" target="_blank">www.ruck.us</a>) and click” Login” in the top right corner, you will see a link for forgotten passwords.</p>
<h3>I have raised funds through my Ruck.us website. When will I get my money?</h3>
<p>We use Democracy Engine as our fundraising portal. From Democracy Engine’s FAQs:</p>
<blockquote>Democracy Engine distributes funds weekly (to ensure that our political recipients are in compliance with all campaign finance laws).Our distributions cover a period from 12am on Monday to 11:59:59 on Sunday ET (some slight vagaries with donations made between midnight and 3am ET will occur due to the different time zones in which servers exist).</blockquote>
<blockquote>For those receiving funds via ACH direct deposit, we initiate those transfers on Wednesdays and funds deposited in your account on Thursday.</blockquote>
<h3>How long before I can start collecting donations?</h3>
<p>Democracy Engine will often have you up with an hour or two, and promises never to take more than a business day.</p>
<h3>Where do I learn more about Democracy Engine?</h3>
<p>Democracy Engine has a very helpful set of FAQs that you can find here - <a href="http://www.democracyengine.com/faq">http://www.democracyengine.com/faq</a></p>
